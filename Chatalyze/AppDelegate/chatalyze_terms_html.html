          <h4>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES</h4>
          <p>
            Chatalyze is a platform that connects users (“Users”) with celebrities and other well-known persons (“Hosts”). These connections are made through Chatalyze’s sessions and greetings features. Chatalyze sessions are sequenced video chat sessions. During these sessions, multiple Users get to video chat individually with a Host and receive a personalized, digital autograph signed in real-time. Chatalyze greetings are recorded video messages and autographs that Hosts make for Users. All greetings are personalized for the recipient Users. Hosts use an application that Chatalyze provides to make greetings and sign digital autographs during sessions. Each User shall create a User account that enables access to the Chatalyze Services.  For additional information about our Services, check out “Home” on our website.
