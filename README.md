## Installation

Chatalyze requires [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) & [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) to install the dependencies.

We prefer Carthage over CocoaPods because of its framework builds that keep libraries isolated from overall project structure. But some libraries that don't support carthage like [GoogleWebRTC](https://cocoapods.org/pods/GoogleWebRTC) need CocoaPods support.

Install the Carthage dependencies
```sh
$ cd chatalyze
$ carthage update --platform iOS
```

Install the CocoaPods dependencies

```sh
$ cd chatalyze
$ pods install
```
